            BLACK-JACK
        </h1>
        
        <p>
            Card Values: <br/>
            1. Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value. <br/>
            2. Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are each worth 10. <br/>
            3. Aces can be the value of 1 or 11, depending on which value benefits the hand more. <br/>
        </p>

        <p> 
            Objective: <br/>
            The main goal of Blackjack is to beat the dealer by having a hand value closer to 21 (targetValue) without exceeding it.
        </p>

        <p> 
            Game Start: <br/>
            Players are dealt two cards, facing up. <br/>
            The dealer receives one card facing up and one facing down.
        </p>

        <p> 
            Player's Turn: <br/>
            Players can choose to "Hit" to receive additional cards. <br/>
            Players can "Stand" to keep their current hand and end their turn. <br/>
            Players can continue to "Hit" until they decide to "Stand" or until bust, their hand value exceeds 21 (targetValue).
        </p>

        <p>
            Dealer's Turn: <br/>
            The dealer reveals their card that is facing down (hole card). <br/>
            The dealer must "Hit" until their hand value is at least 17 (dealerMaxValue). <br/>
            The dealer must "Stand" if their hand value is 17 (dealerMaxValue) or higher.
        </p>

        <p>
            Result: <br/>
            Player wins: Player gains the amount of money betted <br/>
            Dealer wins: Player loses the amount of money betted <br/>
            Tie: -nothing happens -
